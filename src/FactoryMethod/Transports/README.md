In this example, the ITransport interface defines the transport object, Truck and Ship are specific implementations of the transport, and TransportFactory is an abstract class that defines a factory method for creating the transports. The TruckFactory and ShipFactory classes are concrete implementations of the factory that create and return specific transports, Truck and Ship, respectively.

The client code can then use the factory method to create transports without having to know the specific class of the transport being created, as long as they know the factory class.

```csharp
TransportFactory factory = new TruckFactory();
ITransport transport = factory.CreateTransport();
transport.Deliver();
```
