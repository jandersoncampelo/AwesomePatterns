In this example, the IProduct interface defines the product object, ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB are specific implementations of the product, and Creator is an abstract class that defines a factory method for creating the products. The ConcreteCreatorA and ConcreteCreatorB classes are concrete implementations of the creator that create and return specific products, ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB, respectively.

The client code can then use the factory method to create products without having to know the specific class of the product being created, as long as they know the creator class.

```csharp
Creator creator = new ConcreteCreatorA();
IProduct product = creator.FactoryMethod();
```
